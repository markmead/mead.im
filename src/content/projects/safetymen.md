## The challenge

The client wanted to automate the whole courses process for themselves and the customers.

## The solution

- Build out a CRUD app with Ruby on Rails for courses
- Create a custom admin area to manage courses
- Implement Stripe payment and courses booking for customers
- Add autofill search where courses have multiple search terms

## What we built

![Home](../images/safetymen/home.png)
Shows upcoming courses that are bookable below the banner.

![Search](../images/safetymen/search.png)
Custom search implemented with [StimulusJS](https://stimulusjs.org/) with JSON data supplied from Rails.

![Course](../images/safetymen/course.png)
