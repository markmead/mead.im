### The challenge

The client wanted to automate the whole courses process for themselves and the customers.

### The solution

- Build out a CRUD app with Ruby on Rails for courses
- Create a custom admin area to manage courses
- Implement Stripe payment and courses booking for customers
- Add autofill search where courses have multiple search terms

### What we built

- Shows upcoming courses that are bookable below the banner.
- Custom search implemented with [StimulusJS](https://stimulusjs.org/) with JSON data supplied from Rails.
- Individual courses that showcase off the courses info, as well as upcoming bookable courses.
- An admin dasboard to manage courses, news and bookable courses (events).
- Courses view in the admin dashboard with pagination, category filtering and search.
- Individual course form with WSYIWYG editor built from [Trix](https://trix-editor.org/).
