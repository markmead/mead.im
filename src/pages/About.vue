          <h2>ðŸ‘‹ Hi I'm Mark Mead!</h2>
          <p>I'm a 23 year old web developer in Essex, United Kingdom.</p>
          <p>
            Over the past 4 years I've been building websites with a range of different technologies, here's a list of
            work that I've done:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Worked closely with backend developers to improve the performance of a travel insurance quote engine</li>
            <li>Improved the semantic markup and accessibility of a travel insurance quote engine, this allowed the business to use this quote engine as a template to build client sites from which greatly improved development workflow</li>
            <li>Used Shopify to build ecommerce websites</li>
            <li>Built a range of websites using Rails and an open source CMS I work on, these websites range from brochure/lead driven, directory listing/lookup, forums and quizes</li>
            <li>I spend time improving workflow, this allows me to keep up to date with the latest technologies and make decisions on what the team should use</li>
            <li>Pair with junior developers to bring them up to speed and increase their knowledge</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Code</h3>
          <p>Day to day I use Rails, Stimulus, Alpine, Tailwind and Webpack.</p>
          <p>This website features Rails, Tailwind, Vue (Gridsome) and GraphQl.</p>
          <p>I've used React, it's something I love and keep up to date with but for work we prefer Vue. This site was originally written in React, NextJS in fact but I wanted to experiment with Gridsome.</p>
